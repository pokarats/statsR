## Submit your homework via moodle.
## You are required to work together in groups of three students, but everybody 
## needs to submit the group version of the homework via moodle individually.
## You need to provide a serious attempt at solving each exercise in order to have
## the assignment graded as complete. 

## Please write below your (and your teammates') name and matriculation number. 
## Name:Noon Pokaratsiri Goldstein

## Many of the things on this exercise sheet have not been discussed in class. 
## The answers will therefore not be on  the slides. You are expected to find 
## the answers using the help function in R, in the textbooks and online. If you 
## get stuck on these exercises, remember: Google is your friend.
## If you have any questions, you can ask these during the tutorial, or use the 
## moodle discussion board for the course.

###############
### Exercise 1: Getting started
###############
## a) Look at your current working directory.
getwd()

## b) Get help with this function.
?getwd() #or 
help(getwd())


## c) Change your working directory to another directory.
#setwd(/path/to/another/working/directory) #I commented this out because I don't actually want to change my wd

### Exercise 2: Participants' age & boxplots
###############
## In this exercise, we will deal with data from a package.

## a) Install the package "languageR" and load it.
install.packages("languageR")

## b) Specifically, we will deal with the dataset 'dutchSpeakersDistMeta'. 
##    This dataset should be available to you once you've loaded languageR.
##    The dataset contains information on the speakers included in the Spoken 
##    Dutch Corpus. Inspect 'dutchSpeakersDistMeta'. Look at the head, tail, 
##    and summary. What do head and tail show you?
library(languageR)
head(dutchSpeakersDistMeta)
tail(dutchSpeakersDistMeta)
summary(dutchSpeakersDistMeta)
#head shows the first numbers of rows of data, in this case, Speakers N01001-N01006.
#tail shows the last numbers of rows of data, in this case, Speakers N01216-N01221.
#summary shows a run down of the data and basic statistics such as the quartiles, min, max, mean,
#and counts by variable categories

## c) Each line in this file provides information on a single speaker. How many 
##    speakers are included in this dataset? In other words, use a function to 
##    retrieve the number of rows for this dataset.
nrow(dutchSpeakersDistMeta)

## d) Let's say we're interested in the age of the speakers included in the 
##    corpus, to see whether males and females are distributed equally. 
##    Create a boxplot for Sex and AgeYear.
boxplot(AgeYear ~ Sex, data = dutchSpeakersDistMeta)



## e) Does it seem as if either of the two groups has more variability in age?
#yes, the female group has wider variability than the male group. 

## f) Do you see any outliers in either of the two groups?
#yes, The male group also has a few extreme data points outside of the whiskers in the boxplots

## g) Now calculate the mean and standard deviation of the AgeYear per group. 
##    Do this by creating a subset for each group.
##    Do the groups seem to differ much in age?
library(dplyr)
dutchSpeakersDistMeta %>% 
  group_by(Sex) %>%
  summarise(Mean = mean(AgeYear, na.rm = TRUE))

dutchSpeakersDistMeta %>% 
  group_by(Sex) %>%
  summarise(StandardDev = sd(AgeYear, na.rm = TRUE))
#The two groups seem to have almost the same mean and standard deviation, suggesting that they do not differ
#much in age.

## h) What do the whiskers of a boxplot mean?
#The whiskers go from the Q1 and Q3 points of the data to the min and max respectively.

### Exercise 3: Children's stories & dataframes
###############
# A researcher is interested in the way children tell stories. More specifically,
# she wants to know how often children use 'and then'. She asks 25 children to
# tell her a story, and counts the number of times they use 'and then'.
# The data follow:

# 18 15 22 19 18 17 18 20 17 12 16 16 17 21 25 18 20 21 20 20 15 18 17 19 20 


## a) What measurement scale is this data? Is it discrete or continuous? Explain
##    in one sentence why? (remember, comment out written answers)


## b) In the next questions (c-e), you will create a dataframe of this data, 
##    which will also include participant IDs.
##    Why is a dataframe better suited to store this data than a matrix?


## c) First create a vector with participant IDs. Your vector should be named 
##    'pps', and your participants should be labeled from 1 to 25


## d) Next, create a vector containing all the observations. Name this vector 'obs'.


## e) Create a dataframe for this data. Assign this to 'stories'. 


## f) Take a look at the summary of your dataframe, and at the classes of your 
##    columns. What class is the variable 'pps'?


## g) Change the class of 'pps' to factor. Why is factor a better class for this
##    variable?


## h) Plot a histogram (using hist()) for these data. Set the number of breaks 
##    to 8.



## i) Create a kernel density plot using density().


## j) What is the difference between a histogram and a kernel density plot?

## This is a difficult one, remember you just need to provide a serious attempt at solving each 
## exercise in order to pass. 
## k) Overlay the histogram with the kernel density plot 
##    (hint: the area under the curve should be equal for overlaying the graphs 
##    correctly.)



###############
### Exercise 4: Normal distributions
###############
## In this exercise, we will plot normal distributions.

## a) First, use seq() (?seq) to select the x-values to plot the range for
##    (will become the x-axis in the plot).
##    Get R to generate the range from -5 to 5, by 0.1. Assign this to the 
##    variable x.


## b) Now we need to obtain the y-values of the plot (the density). We do this 
##    using the density function for the normal distribution. 
##    Use "help(dnorm)" to find out about the standard functions for the normal 
##    distribution.


## c) Now use plot() to plot the normal distribution for z values of "x". 


## d) The plot now has a relatively short y-range, and it contains circles 
##    instead of a line. 
##    Using plot(), specify the y axis to range from 0 to 0.8, and plot a line 
##    instead of the circles.


## e) We want to have a vertical line to represent the mean of our distribution.
##    'abline()' can do this for us. Look up help for abline(). 
##    Use abline() to create the vertical line. Specify the median of x using
##    the argument 'v'.
##    In order to get a dashed line, set the argument 'lty' to 2.

## f) Take a look at the beaver1 dataset. (You can see it by typing "beaver1".) 
##    Then select only the temperature part and store it in a variable "b1temp".

## g) Calculate the mean and standard deviation of this dataset and plot a normal
##    distribution with these parameters.

## h) We observe two temparatures (36.91 and 38.13). What's the likelihood that
##    these temperatures (or more extreme ones) respectively come 
##    from the normal distribution from g)?

## i) Use the random sampling function in R to generate 20 random samples from
##    the normal distribution from g), and draw a histogram based on this sample.
##    Repeat 5 times. What do you observe?
