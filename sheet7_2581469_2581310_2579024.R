### Exercise 1: Preparation
#######################

library(boot)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape)

# This time we will be working with the "amis" data frame (package 'boot') that has 
# 8437 rows and 4 columns.

# In a study into the effect that warning signs have on speeding patterns, 
# Cambridgeshire County Council considered 14 pairs of locations. The locations were 
# paired to account for factors such as traffic, volume and type of road. One site in 
# each pair had a sign erected warning of the dangers of speeding and asking drivers 
# to slow down. No action was taken at the second site. Three sets of measurements 
# were taken at each site. 
# Each set of measurements was nominally of the speeds of 100 cars but not all sites 
# have exactly 100 measurements. These speed measurements were taken before the 
# erection of the sign, shortly after the erection of the sign, and again after 
# the sign had been in place for some time.

# a) For the further reference please use ?amis. 
# It may take some time to understand the dataset. 


# b) Load the dataset, store it into a variable called "data", and briefly inspect it. 
# Feel free to make some plots and calculate some statistics in order to understand 
# the data.


# c) All our columns have numeric type. Convert the categorial columns to factors.


# d) Plot boxplots for the distribution of `speed` for each of the `period` values 
# (before, immediately after and after some time). Build 2 plots (each containing 3 
# boxplots) side by side depending on the `warning` variable.
# (For all plots here and below please use ggplot)


# e) What can you conclude looking at the plots? What can you say about people's 
# behaviour in different periods: before, immediately after and after some time?


# f) What are your ideas about why the data with warning==2 (sites where no sign was 
# erected) was collected?


#######################
### Exercise 2: 1-way ANOVA
#######################

# a) First let's create a new data frame which will be used for all exercise 2.
# For the 1-way ANOVA we will be working with a subset of `amis` using only the 
# data for sites where warning signs were erected, which corresponds to warning==1. 
# Therefore first subset your data to filter out warning==2 and then apply cast() 
# to average "speed" over each "pair" and "period". 
# Assign this new data frame to the variable casted_data.


# b) Build boxplots of the average speed depending on "period".


# c) Looking at the boxplots, is there a difference between the periods?


# Now, let's check the ANOVA assumptions and whether they are violated or not 
# and why.

# d) Independence assumption
# (Figure out the best way to check this assumption and give a detailed justified 
# answer to whether it is violated or not.)

# e) Normality of residuals
# (Figure out the best way to check this assumption and give a detailed justified 
# answer to whether it is violated or not.)

# f) Homogeneity of variance of residuals
# (Figure out the best way to check this assumption and give a detailed justified 
# answer to whether it is violated or not.)

# g) Now we are ready to perform 1-way ANOVA: please use the function aov() on the 
# speed depending on the period, report p-value and interpret the result in details.


# h) Please do pairwise t-tests of the same variables as in g) using pairwise.t.test().


# i) Report the pairwise p-values and interpret the result in detail.


# j) Try to use no adjustment for pairwise testing and then the Bonferroni correction.
# Does the result change?


#######################
### Exercise 3: 2-way ANOVA
#######################
# a) Now we want to analyze the influence of 2 categorial variables 
# (period and warning) on the speed.
# So let's turn back to our initial dataset amis (not its subset with warning==1).
# First, we need to average the speed over each `pair`, `warning` and `period
# Cast your data again and assign the resuts to casted_data2.

# b) Calculate the mean for each of the 6 possible pairs of `period` and `warning`.


# c) Do you think there is a significant difference between some of the groups?


# d) Now apply the 2-way ANOVA: please use the function aov() on the speed depending 
# on the period and warning.
# Report the p-value and interpret the result in detail.


# e) What do you conclude about the behaviour of drivers based on the 2-way ANOVA?
