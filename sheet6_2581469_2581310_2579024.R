### Exercise 1: Correlation
#######################

# a) Get some data - access the ratings data set in languageR and name it "data".
# The data set contains subjective frequency ratings and their length averaged over 
# subjects, for 81 concrete English nouns.


# b) Take a look at the data frame.


# c) Let's say you're interested in whether there is a linear relationship between 
# the word frequency of the 81 nouns and their length.
# Take a look at the relationship between the frequency and word length data by 
# means of a scatterplot (use the ggplot library for this).


# d) Judging from the graphs, do you think that word frequency and word length are 
# in any way correlated with one another?


# e) Compute the Pearson correlation coefficient for the two variables by means 
# of cor().
# Tell R to only include complete pairs of observations.
# As a reminder: Pearson coefficient denotes the covariance of the two variables 
# divided by the product of their respective variance. 
# It is scaled between 1 (for a perfect positive correlation) to -1 (for a perfect 
# negative correlation).


# f) Does the correlation coefficient suggest a small, medium or large effect?
# What about the direction of the effect?


# g) Note that we have a large number of tied ranks in word length data 
# (since there are multiple words with the length of e.g. 5).
# Thus, we might draw more accurate conclusions by setting the method to 
# Kendall's tau instead of the Pearson correlation coefficient (which is the default).
# How do you interpret the difference between these 2 correlation coefficients?


# h) What about significance? Use the more user-friendly cor.test()!
# Take a look at the output and describe what's in there.
# What do you conclude?


# i) Finally, also calculate Spearman's rank correlation for the same data.


#######################
### Exercise 2: Regression
#######################

# a) Fit a linear regression model to the data frame "data" from exercise 1 
# for the variables Frequency (outcome variable) and Length (predictor variable).
# General form: 
# "modelname <- lm(outcome ~ predictor, data = dataFrame, na.action = an action)"


# b) How do you interpret the output? Is the relationship between the two variables 
# positive or negative?
# Plot the data points and the regression line.


# c) Run the plotting command again and have R display the actual words that belong 
# to each point. 
# (Don't worry about readability of overlapping words.)


#######################
### Exercise 3: Regression
#######################


# a) Try this again for another example:
# Let's go back to our digsym data set.
# Set your wd and load the data frame digsym_clean.csv and store it in a variable.
# You can download this data frame from the material of week 6: t-test and friends. 


# b) Suppose you want to predict reaction times in the digit symbol task by 
# people's age.
# Fit a linear regression model to the data frame for the variables 
# correct_RT_2.5sd (outcome variable) and Age (predictor variable).
# General form: 
# "modelname <- lm(outcome ~ predictor, data = dataFrame, na.action = an action)"
# But first we need to cast the data to compute an RT mean (use correct_RT_2.5sd) 
# for each subject, so that we have only one Age observation per Subject.
# Store the result in a new dataframe called "cast".
# In case you're wondering why we still have to do this - like the t-test, 
# linear regression assumes independence of observations.
# In other words, one row should correspond to one subject or item only.


# c) Now fit the regression model.


# d) Let's go over the output - what's in there?
# How do you interpret the output?


# e) Plot the data points and the regression line. 


# f) Plot a histogram and qq-plot of the residuals. 
# Does their distribution look like a normal distribution?


# g) Plot Cook's distance for the regression model from c) which estimates the 
# residuals (i.e. distance between the actual values and the  predicted value on 
# the regression line) for individual data points in the model.


# h) Judging from the plot in g) it actually looks like we have 1 influential 
# observation in there that has potential to distort (and pull up) our regression 
# line.
# The last observation (row 37) in cast has a very high Cook's distance 
# (greater than 0.6).
# In other words, the entire regression function would change by more than 
# 0.6 when this particular case would be deleted.
# What is the problem with observation 37?
# Run the plotting command again and have R display the subjects that belong to 
# each point.


# i) Make a subset of "cast" by excluding the influential subject and name it cast2.


# j) Fit the model from c) again, using cast2, and take a good look at the output.


# k) What's different about the output?
# How does that change your interpretation of whether age is predictive of RTs?


# l) Plot the regression line again - notice the difference in slope in 
# comparison to our earlier model fit?


# m) Display the two plots side by side to better see what's going on.


# n) Compute the proportion of variance in RT that can be accounted for by Age.
# In other words: Compute R Squared.
# Take a look at the Navarro book (Chapter on regression) if you have trouble 
# doing this.


# o) How do you interpret R Squared?
