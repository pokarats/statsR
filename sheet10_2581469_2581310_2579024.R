#Part 1
####
# The folder speed.dating
# contains data from an experiment on a few hundred students that randomly assigned
# each participant to 10 short dates with participants of the opposite sex
# (Fisman et al., 2006). For each date, each person recorded several subjective
# numerical ratings of the other person (attractiveness, compatibility, and some 
# other characteristics) and also wrote down whether he or she would like to meet
# the other person again. Label and rij1, . . . , rij6 as person iâ€™s numerical ratings of person j 
# on the dimensions of attractiveness, compatibility, and so forth.




#(1) Fit a classical logistic regression predicting Pr(yij = 1) given person i's 
#    ratings of person j. For ratings, use the features attr, sinc, intel, fun; see the documentation for what exactly these
#    abbreviations stand for.
#    Also, please plot the data in order to inspect it, and discuss the importance of attractiveness, compatibility, and so 
#    forth in this predictive model.
dat = read.csv('SpeedDatingData.csv')
head(dat)

#(2) Expand this model to allow varying intercepts for the persons making the
#    evaluation; that is, some people are more likely than others to want to meet
#    someone again. Discuss the fitted model.
model <- glm(match ~ attr + sinc + intel + fun, family = binomial, data = dat)
summary(model)

# attraction
mdat <- melt(dat, id.vars = c("attr"),
             measure.vars = c("match"))
cdat <- dcast(mdat, attr ~ variable, mean, na.rm = T)
ggplot(cdat, aes(attr, match)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'glm', se = FALSE)

# sincerity
mdat_s <- melt(dat, id.vars = c("sinc"),
             measure.vars = c("match"))
cdat_s <- dcast(mdat_s, sinc ~ variable, mean, na.rm = T)
ggplot(cdat_s, aes(sinc, match)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'glm', se = FALSE)

# intelligence
mdat_i <- melt(dat, id.vars = c("intel"),
               measure.vars = c("match"))
cdat_i <- dcast(mdat_i, intel ~ variable, mean, na.rm = T)
ggplot(cdat_i, aes(intel, match)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'glm', se = FALSE)

# fun
mdat_f <- melt(dat, id.vars = c("fun"),
               measure.vars = c("match"))
cdat_f <- dcast(mdat_f, fun ~ variable, mean, na.rm = T)
ggplot(cdat_f, aes(fun, match)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'glm', se = FALSE)

# According to the linear model, only attractiveness and fun predictor variables are deemed to be significiant.
# Between these two variables, the slope of the fun variable is slightly higher than the attractiveness variable.
# This suggests that, all else being equal, an increase in fun rating by 1 point increases the expected likelihood
# for a match by 0.317 while an increase in attractiveness by 1 point increases the likelihood of a match by 
# 0.246.

#(3) Expand further to allow varying intercepts for the persons being rated. Discuss
#    the fitted model.

model_mixed <- glmer(match ~ attr + sinc + intel + fun + (1|id) + (1|iid), 
                   family = 'binomial', data = dat)
summary(model_mixed)

# In the general mixed effect model, intelligence is also considered a significant factor affecting
# match in addition to attraction and fun. The slopes of these variables also change slightly, but the fun
# variable still has the highest slope, followed by attraction. For intelligence, an increase in intelligence
# rating by 1 point increases the likelihood of a match by 0.1.

# As noted in the random effects, there is not as much variation among different participants as there is across
# the Waves i.e. the date events.

# The AIC for this model of 6078.8 is lower than that of the non-mixed effect model (6405.7)

#(4) Now fit some models that allow the coefficients for attractiveness, compatibility, and the 
#    other attributes to vary by person.  Fit a multilevel model, allowing the intercept and the 
#    coefficients for the 6 ratings to vary by the rater i. (Hint: The model will not converge when you 
#    include many predictors as random slopes; see with how many predictors you can get the model to converge;
#    and try out some of the tricks we have seen to see whether they affect convergence for this dataset.)

# treating intercepts and slopes separately by random factor; converged
model_mixed_2 <- glmer(match ~ attr + sinc + intel + fun + amb + (attr||id) + (fun||id) + (intel||id) + (amb||id), 
                       family = 'binomial', data = dat)
summary(model_mixed_2)

# treating intercepts and slopes together by random factor; does not converge
model_mixed_3 <- glmer(match ~ attr + sinc + intel + fun + amb + (1 + attr|id) + (1 + fun|id) + (1 + intel|id) + 
                         (1 + amb|id), family = 'binomial', data = dat)
summary(model_mixed_3)

#(5) compare the output for the different models that you calculated - did the model design affect your conclusions?

# In both models, the fun variable still has the highest slope. When considering the intercepts and slopes together
# the only variables that are signficant are attraction, fun, and ambition, although ambition has a negative
# correlation with match.

#Part 2

# In this example, num_awards is the outcome variable and indicates the number of awards earned by students at
# a high school in a year, math is a continuous predictor variable and represents students' scores on their 
# math final exam, and prog is a categorical predictor variable with three levels indicating the type of program 
# in which the students were enrolled. It is coded as 1 = "General", 2 = "Academic" and 3 = "Vocational". 
# Let's start with loading the data and looking at some descriptive statistics.

p = read.csv("poisson_sim.csv", sep=";")
p <- within(p, {
  prog <- factor(prog, levels=1:3, labels=c("General", "Academic", "Vocational"))
  id <- factor(id)
})
summary(p)

#(6) Plot the data to see whether program type and math final exam score seem to affect the number of awards.
library(ggplot2)
plot <- ggplot(p, aes(x = math, y = num_awards, color = prog)) + geom_point()
plot + geom_smooth(method = 'glm', se = FALSE)
#(7) Run a generalized linear model to test for significance of effects.
mod <- glm(num_awards ~ math + prog, data = p, family = 'poisson')
summary(mod)

mod_mixed <- glmer(num_awards ~ math*prog + (1 + math||id), data = p, family = 'poisson')
summary(mod_mixed)
#(8) Do model comparisons do find out whether the predictors significantly improve model fit.

# not sure what the question is asking here; are we to try different models with different predictor variables
# and compare which one has lower AIC?
mod_null <- glm(num_awards ~ math, data = p, family = 'poisson')
summary(mod_null)

mod_inter <- glm(num_awards ~ math * prog, data = p, family = 'poisson')
summary(mod_inter)

AIC(mod, mod_null, mod_inter, mod_mixed)


# It appears that the type of program predictor variable improves the model fit as it has the lowest AIC score among
# all the models. However, the difference in AIC scores among all the 4 models are < 10, which does not seem to
# be a huge difference.

#(9) Compare to a model that uses a gaussian distribution (normal lm model) for this data.
mod_gaussian <-glm(num_awards ~ math + prog, data = p, family = 'gaussian')
summary(mod_gaussian)
AIC(mod, mod_gaussian)
# clearly the non-gaussian model has a signficantly better fit as the AIC score is almost 200 points lower than
# the guassian model.
