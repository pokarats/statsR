#Part 1

# The folder speed.dating
# contains data from an experiment on a few hundred students that randomly assigned
# each participant to 10 short dates with participants of the opposite sex
# (Fisman et al., 2006). For each date, each person recorded several subjective
# numerical ratings of the other person (attractiveness, compatibility, and some 
# other characteristics) and also wrote down whether he or she would like to meet
# the other person again. Label and rij1, . . . , rij6 as person iâ€™s numerical ratings of person j 
# on the dimensions of attractiveness, compatibility, and so forth.



#(1) Fit a classical logistic regression predicting Pr(yij = 1) given person i's 
#    ratings of person j. For ratings, use the features attr, sinc, intel, fun; see the documentation for what exactly these
#    abbreviations stand for.
#    Also, please plot the data in order to inspect it, and discuss the importance of attractiveness, compatibility, and so 
#    forth in this predictive model.


#(2) Expand this model to allow varying intercepts for the persons making the
#    evaluation; that is, some people are more likely than others to want to meet
#    someone again. Discuss the fitted model.

#(3) Expand further to allow varying intercepts for the persons being rated. Discuss
#    the fitted model.

#(4) Now fit some models that allow the coefficients for attractiveness, compatibility, and the 
#    other attributes to vary by person.  Fit a multilevel model, allowing the intercept and the 
#    coefficients for the 6 ratings to vary by the rater i. (Hint: The model will not converge when you 
#    include many predictors as random slopes; see with how many predictors you can get the model to converge;
#    and try out some of the tricks we have seen to see whether they affect convergence for this dataset.)


#(5) compare the output for the different models that you calculated - did the model design affect your conclusions?

#Part 2

# In this example, num_awards is the outcome variable and indicates the number of awards earned by students at
# a high school in a year, math is a continuous predictor variable and represents students' scores on their 
# math final exam, and prog is a categorical predictor variable with three levels indicating the type of program 
# in which the students were enrolled. It is coded as 1 = "General", 2 = "Academic" and 3 = "Vocational". 
# Let's start with loading the data and looking at some descriptive statistics.

p = read.csv("poisson_sim.csv", sep=";")
p <- within(p, {
  prog <- factor(prog, levels=1:3, labels=c("General", "Academic", "Vocational"))
  id <- factor(id)
})
summary(p)

#(6) Plot the data to see whether program type and math final exam score seem to affect the number of awards.

#(7) Run a generalized linear model to test for significance of effects.

#(8) Do model comparisons do find out whether the predictors significantly improve model fit.

#(9) Compare to a model that uses a gaussian distribution (normal lm model) for this data.
