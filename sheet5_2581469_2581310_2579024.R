### Cleaning Data
###############

library(lsr)
library(tidyr)
library(effsize)
library(tidyverse)

# 1. Download the data file "digsym_clean.csv" from the moodle and save it in your 
# working directory. 


# 2. Read in the data into a variable called "data".
data <- read.csv("digsym_clean.csv")
str(data)
# 3. Get rid of the column "X"
library(dplyr)
data <- select(data, -c(X))

# Say you're interested in whether people respond with different accuracy to 
# right vs. wrong picture-symbol combinations.
# In other words, you want to compare the average accuracy for the digsym-right 
# and digsym-wrong condition.
# Like the conscientious researcher you are, you want to take a look at the data 
# before you get into the stats.
# Therefore, you will need to create a barplot of the mean accuracy data 
# (split out by condition) using ggplot and the summarySE function (given below).
# Let's do it step by step.

summarySE <- function(data=NULL, measurevar, groupvars=NULL, na.rm=FALSE, conf.interval=.95) {
  # data: an input dataframe
  # measurevar: a column name of <data> (as string), on which we would like to calculate 
  #             standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE) and confidence interval (CI).
  # groupvars: categorical columns of <data> (as vector of strings ) which we would like to use
  #            to make all possible combinations for which we calculate SD, SE, CI based 
  #            on <measurevar>.
  # na.rm: should we remove NA
  # conf.interval: confidence interval
  library(doBy)
  
  length2 <- function (x, na.rm=FALSE) {
    if (na.rm) sum(!is.na(x))
    else       length(x)
  }
  
  # Collapse the data
  formula <- as.formula(paste(measurevar, paste(groupvars, collapse=" + "), sep=" ~ "))
  datac <- summaryBy(formula, data=data, FUN=c(length2,mean,sd), na.rm=na.rm)
  
  # Rename columns
  names(datac)[ names(datac) == paste(measurevar, ".mean",    sep="") ] <- measurevar
  names(datac)[ names(datac) == paste(measurevar, ".sd",      sep="") ] <- "sd"
  names(datac)[ names(datac) == paste(measurevar, ".length2", sep="") ] <- "N"
  
  # Calculate standard error of the mean
  datac$se <- datac$sd / sqrt(datac$N)  
  
  # Confidence interval multiplier for standard error
  # Calculate t-statistic for confidence interval: 
  # e.g., if conf.interval is .95, use .975 (above/below), and use df=N-1
  ciMult <- qt(conf.interval/2 + .5, datac$N-1)
  datac$ci <- datac$se * ciMult
  
  return(datac)
}

# 4. Apply the function summarySE on the accuracy data grouping by right/wrong condition
# (use the provided documentation inside the function above for the arguments description).

glimpse(data)

accuracy_by_right_wrong <- summarySE(data = data, "accuracy", "condition", na.rm = T)

# 5. Create the barplot (use ggplot2 for this and all tasks below) with error bars 
# (which the function summarySE readily provided).
# Gauging from the plot, does it look like there's a huge difference in accuracy 
# for responses to the right and wrong condition?
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(accuracy_by_right_wrong, aes(condition, accuracy)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = accuracy - sd, ymax = accuracy + sd), width = 0.2)
# from the plot, there doesn't seem to be a huge difference in response accuracy between the 2 condition groups

# 6. Let's go back to our data frame "data", which is still loaded in your console
# Now that you've taken a look at the data, you want to get into the stats.
# You want to compute a t-test for the average accuracy data in the right and 
# wrong condition.
# Why can't you compute a t-test on the data as they are now? 
# Hint: Which assumption is violated?

## we don't know (yet) if the data follows a normal distribution when plotted.

# 7. We need to reshape the data to only one observation (average accuracy) per subject 
# and right/wrong condition. Here we will use cast() which we discussed in the tutorial
# for sheet 2. 
# Collapse the data, 
# using cast(data, var1 + var2 + var3 ... ~, function, value = var4, na.rm = T).
# Store the result in a new variable called "cdata". 
## Check ?cast or https://www.statmethods.net/management/reshape.html for more infos on 
## cast(). 
library(reshape2)
?cast
glimpse(data)
summary(data)
mdata <- melt(data, id.vars = c("Subject", "condition"),
     measure.vars = c("accuracy"))
cdata <- dcast(mdata, condition + Subject ~ variable, mean, na.rm = T)
# 8. Create histograms of the accuracy data depending on the right and wrong 
# condition and display them side by side.
#ggplot(cdata, aes(Subject, accuracy, fill = condition)) + geom_col(position = 'dodge')
ggplot(cdata, aes(accuracy, fill = condition)) + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(~condition)
# 9. Display the same data in density plots. 
ggplot(cdata, aes(accuracy, color = condition)) + geom_density()

# 10. Based on the histograms and the density plots - are these data normally 
# distibuted?
# no

# 11. Create boxplots of the accuracy data.            
ggplot(cdata, aes(Subject, accuracy, group = condition, color = condition)) + geom_boxplot()

# 12. Compute the t-test to compare the mean accuracy between wrong and right picture
# combinations.
# Do you need a paired t-test or independent sample t-test? why?
# we need the paired t-test because the 2 groups (right and wrong) are from the same sampling
t.test(accuracy ~ condition, data = cdata, paired = T)

# 13. What does the output tell you? What conclusions do you draw?
# The p-value of 0.000588 is less than the alpa value of 0.05 so we can reject the null hypothesis
# and conclude that the difference in the means between the 2 groups is statistically significant

# 14. Compute the effect size using CohensD.
library(effsize)
?cohensD
cohensD(accuracy ~ condition, data = cdata)

# 15. Which effect size do we get? How do you interpret this result?
# The effect size from the Cohen's d calculation is 0.77657 (medium)
# Depending on the application of the study and other studies out there,
# this may mean an important difference between the two group averages or a trivial one

# 16. In addition to the long-format data we've just been working on, you may also 
# encounter data sets in a wide format (this is the format we have been using in 
# class examples.)
# Let's do a transformation of our data set (cdata) to see what it would look like in a wide 
# format.
# Use spread() from the tidyr package.
?spread
cdata_wide <- cdata %>% spread(condition, accuracy)
# 17. Compute the t-test again on the wide format data - note that for wide-format 
# data you need to use a different annotation for the t-test.
?t.test()
t.test(cdata_wide$right, cdata_wide$wrong, paired = T)

# 18. Compare the t-test results from the wide-format and the long-format data. 
# What do you notice?
# The t-test results from both format data are the same. The difference was how to code the arguments of the 
# function

# 19. Compute CohensD on the wide format data. What do you notice?
cohensD(cdata_wide$right, cdata_wide$wrong)
# the cohensD on the wide format data is also the same.

# 20. Let's try the t-test again, but for a different question:
# Suppose you are interested in whether reaction times in the digit symbol 
# task differ depending on gender.
# In other words, you want to test whether or not men perform significantly 
# faster on average than women, or vice versa.
# Collapse the original data, using 
# cast(data, var1 + var2 + var3 ... ~ ., function, value = var4, na.rm = T).
# Store the result in a new variable called "cdat"
glimpse(data)
mdat <- melt(data, id.vars = c("Subject", "Gender"),
              measure.vars = c("accuracy"))
cdat <- dcast(mdat, Gender + Subject ~ variable, mean, na.rm = T)
# 21. Take a look at cdat using head().
head(cdat)

# 22. Compute the t-test to compare the accuracy means of female and male 
# participants.
# Which t-test do you need and why? How do you interpret the result?
# We need the independent t-test because the groups are 2 different samples from the population.
t.test(accuracy ~ Gender, data = cdat)
# from the t-test, the p-value is 0.7319, which suggest that we cannot reject the null hypothesis
# for alpha = 0.05. The p-value can be interpreted as the probability that the observed difference in means
# between the 2 groups is due to chance.
